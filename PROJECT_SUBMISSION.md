## Repository Information
- **Repository**: This project is contained in the current directory structure
- **Access**: All files are publicly accessible
- **Main Class**: `src/edu/ccrm/cli/CCRMApplication.java`

## Project Overview

The Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM) is a comprehensive console-based Java application that demonstrates advanced Java SE concepts while providing practical functionality for educational institutions.

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **Student Management**: Complete CRUD operations with validation
- **Course Management**: Full course lifecycle with search capabilities
- **Enrollment System**: Business rule enforcement (credit limits, prerequisites)
- **Grade Management**: Recording, calculation, and GPA computation
- **Transcript Generation**: Formatted academic records
- **File Operations**: CSV import/export with NIO.2
- **Backup System**: Timestamped backups with recursive operations

### ✅ Technical Requirements Met

#### OOP Principles
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with controlled access
- **Inheritance**: Abstract `Person` class → `Student`/`Instructor`
- **Abstraction**: Abstract methods and interfaces
- **Polymorphism**: Method overriding and interface implementations

#### Design Patterns
- **Singleton**: `AppConfig` for configuration management
- **Builder**: `Student.Builder` and `Course.Builder` for complex object creation

#### Modern Java Features
- **Streams API**: Extensive use for data processing and reporting
- **Lambda Expressions**: Functional programming throughout
- **Optional**: Null-safe operations
- **NIO.2**: Modern file I/O with `Path` and `Files`
- **Date/Time API**: `LocalDateTime` for all timestamps

#### Exception Handling
- **Custom Exception Hierarchy**: Base `CCRMException` with specific subclasses
- **Try-with-resources**: Automatic resource management
- **Multi-catch**: Comprehensive error handling

#### Advanced Concepts
- **Nested Classes**: Static and inner classes demonstrated
- **Enums**: Complex enums with constructors and methods
- **Functional Interfaces**: Custom predicates and comparators
- **Assertions**: Runtime validation throughout

## Implementation Approach

### Architecture
The application follows a clean layered architecture:
1. **CLI Layer** - User interface and menu system
2. **Service Layer** - Business logic and operations
3. **Domain Layer** - Core entities and value objects
4. **I/O Layer** - File operations and persistence
5. **Utility Layer** - Helper classes and common functionality
6. **Configuration Layer** - Application settings

### Key Design Decisions
- **Interface-based Services**: Allows for different implementations
- **Immutable Value Objects**: Thread-safe and predictable
- **Functional Programming**: Leverages Java 8+ features extensively
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Input validation at multiple layers
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of exceptional conditions

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- JDK 17 or higher
- Any Java IDE (Eclipse recommended)
- Command line access

### Compilation and Execution
```bash
# Compile the project
javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/edu/ccrm/cli/CCRMApplication.java

# Run the application (with assertions enabled)
java -ea -cp bin edu.ccrm.cli.CCRMApplication
```

### IDE Setup (Eclipse)
1. Create new Java Project named "CCRM"
2. Copy all source files to the `src` folder
3. Set JDK 17+ as project JRE
4. Run `CCRMApplication` as Java Application
5. Add `-ea` to VM arguments for assertions

## Sample Data
The project includes comprehensive test data:
- `test-data/students.csv` - 10 sample students
- `test-data/courses.csv` - 15 sample courses across departments
- `test-data/enrollments.csv` - 24 sample enrollments

## Demonstration Flow

1. **Application Startup**: Shows platform information and initializes sample data
2. **Menu Navigation**: Comprehensive menu system with 8 main categories
3. **Student Operations**: Add, search, update, and generate transcripts
4. **Course Management**: Create courses with Builder pattern
5. **Enrollment Process**: Demonstrates business rule enforcement
6. **Grade Recording**: Shows GPA calculation and letter grade assignment
7. **Reports & Analytics**: Stream-based data analysis and reporting
8. **File Operations**: Import/export with error handling
9. **Backup System**: Recursive directory operations with NIO.2
